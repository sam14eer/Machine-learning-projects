Hello,

1.This repository contains the projects on machine learning in which few of them are on the regression problem and few of them are on the classification problem.

2.you will find both projects in the seperate folders like classification projects and regression projects in the same repository.

3.in this project i tried to undersatnd the data,do feature analysis and perform EDA on the data as per the requirments of the data. 

4.here i had used verious machine learning algorithums which i have learned in my MBA course to train the model of regression and classification.like linear regression,logestic reression,randm forest clssifier,decision tree.

5.along with that i tried to perform some extra things like performing hyper parameter tunning and downsampling to balance the imbalance data (rainfall prediction model,credit card fraude model)
